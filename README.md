#Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone git clone https://github.com/izzy503/exchangeRateApi.git

#Installation and Setup:
Ensure you have node and npm installed. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:

// Install dependencies listed in package.json.
$ npm install 

// Confirm the environment is set up and a live server starts.
$ npm run start 

#Commit any new changes:

$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# API Key Setup Instructions:

### Step 1: Obtain Your Own API Key
1. Navigate to the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) site.
2. Input your email address and click the "Get Free Key" button.
3. Create an account by entering your email, first name, and a password.
4. Agree to the terms of use and click "Get Started!"
5. Once registered, you'll be taken to a dashboard. Here, you'll find your unique API key as well as information about your remaining API calls for the month. Keep this key safe and do not share it with others.

### Step 2: Setting Up the API Key in the Project
1. After cloning the repository to your local machine, navigate to the root directory of the project using your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new file named `.env` in the root directory.
3. Open the `.env` file with a text editor and enter the following:

```
API_KEY=your_unique_api_key
```

Replace `your_unique_api_key` with the API key you obtained from the ExchangeRate-API site.

4. Save and close the `.env` file.

### Note: 
- The `.env` file is used to keep sensitive information, like API keys, private. If you're using Git, ensure that `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being shared on GitHub or other version control platforms.
- Avoid making excessive API calls (like accidental infinite loops) during development, as the Free Plan allows for 2000 API calls per month.

### Step 3: Accessing the API Key in Your Code
Whenever you need to use the API key in your JavaScript code, you can access it with `process.env.API_KEY` (assuming you're using a platform or tool like Node.js that recognizes the `.env` setup).
